# IMMEDIATE FIX: Stop "Mark Reminder Sent" 500 Error

## Problem
You're using a workflow with the "Mark Reminder Sent" step that's causing 500 errors.

## Solution
Import the fixed workflow that removes this problematic step entirely.

## Steps to Fix

### 1. Import Working Workflow
1. In n8n, go to **Workflows** → **Import from File**
2. Select `WORKING_N8N_WORKFLOW.json` from your docs folder
3. Click **Import**
4. **Save** the imported workflow

### 2. Activate New Workflow
1. **Activate** the new "lifebuddy-n8n-workflow-working" workflow
2. **Deactivate** your old workflow that has "Mark Reminder Sent"

### 3. Test
1. Click **Execute Workflow** manually
2. Verify it completes without the 500 error

## Key Difference
- **Old workflow**: Has "Mark Reminder Sent" step → 500 error
- **New workflow**: No "Mark Reminder Sent" step → No error

## Workflow Flow (New)
```
Daily Trigger → Get Schedules → Process → Send Email/Telegram → Log Completion
```

The new workflow skips the problematic "Mark Reminder Sent" endpoint completely, eliminating the 500 error.

**File to import**: `WORKING_N8N_WORKFLOW.json`
