# Backend Timeout Analysis & Solutions

## Issue Summary
The LifeBuddy backend deployed on Railway is completely unresponsive, causing 300-second timeouts in n8n workflows.

## Symptoms
- All API endpoints timing out (tested with 5s, 10s timeouts)
- n8n workflow "Send Email Reminder" node failing with `ECONNABORTED`
- Backend appears to be down or hanging on all requests

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Railway Deployment Issue**: The backend service may have crashed or is not responding
2. **Resource Limits**: Railway free tier may have resource constraints
3. **Code Issues**: Despite simplifying the email endpoint, the entire backend is unresponsive

## Immediate Solutions

### 1. Simplified WhatsApp-Only Workflow
Created `SIMPLIFIED_N8N_WORKFLOW.json` that:
- Only uses WhatsApp reminders via WAHA API
- Bypasses problematic backend email/telegram endpoints
- Still fetches schedule data from backend (if available)
- Falls back gracefully if backend is down

### 2. Backend Investigation Steps
```bash
# Check Railway deployment status
railway status

# View recent logs
railway logs

# Restart the service
railway up --detach
```

### 3. Alternative Backend Solutions
- Deploy to Vercel/Netlify as serverless functions
- Use Render.com as backup deployment
- Implement health check endpoints

## Workflow Modifications Made

### Original Issue
- Email endpoint was generating large HTML templates
- Backend timing out after 300 seconds
- All reminder platforms failing

### Current Solution
- WhatsApp-only workflow using WAHA API directly
- Reduced dependency on backend endpoints
- Faster execution with fewer failure points

## Next Steps
1. Test simplified WhatsApp workflow
2. Investigate Railway deployment status
3. Consider alternative deployment platforms
4. Add health monitoring for backend services

## WAHA Configuration Required
```bash
# Start WAHA container
docker run -it --rm \
  -p 3000:3000/tcp \
  -e WHATSAPP_HOOK_URL=http://localhost:3000/webhook \
  -e WHATSAPP_HOOK_EVENTS=message \
  -e WAHA_API_KEY=your-secret-key-321 \
  devlikeapro/waha

# Start session via QR code
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/sessions/start \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-secret-key-321" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "default"}'
```

## Testing Commands
```bash
# Test WAHA API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/sendText \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-secret-key-321" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "session": "default",
    "chatId": "1234567890@c.us",
    "text": "Test message from LifeBuddy"
  }'
```
